You are responsible for exactly one Beads ticket: TICKET_ID. Do not work on any other ticket.

- You are in your own git worktree on branch wt/TICKET_ID. Commit there. Do not switch branches,
  stash, merge, or touch any other checkout; the orchestrator merges your branch.
- Claim it with `bd update TICKET_ID --claim`, then read it with `bd show TICKET_ID`.
- Check your work with `npm ci --no-audit --no-fund && npm run build && npm test`. It does a clean install from the lockfile,
  the electron-vite build and the Jest suite. While iterating, run only the checks you need, e.g.
  `npm run build` or `npm test`.
- Run `npm ci --no-audit --no-fund && npm run build && npm test` in the foreground, never in the background: while you wait on a background
  command you look idle, and the orchestrator stops the run to ask whether you need an answer.
- Other workers run the same programs and tests on this machine. Never stop processes by name or
  pattern (`pkill`, `killall`, `pkill -f`); stop only those you started, by their PID.
- Other tickets run beside yours and merge first, so don't add where they all add:
  - put new tests in a new test file named after the feature, not at the end of an existing one;
  - add new struct fields, constants and helpers next to the code they belong to, not at the end
    of a list;
  - add a changelog entry as new lines, without rewording or moving the others: with
    `CHANGELOG.md merge=union` in .gitattributes, git keeps both tickets' lines.
- Commit only the files you changed for this ticket, with the ticket ID in the message. Never push.
- File anything new you discover with `bd create`, linked to TICKET_ID. Keep every ticket title
  short, at most 60 characters: a plain summary of the change. Details go in the description.
  When a follow-up touches the same files or functions as another open ticket (see
  `bd list --status open`), link the two so they don't run side by side: `--deps blocked-by:<id>`
  makes the follow-up wait for that ticket, `--deps related:<id>` only notes the overlap. Give a
  follow-up that restructures code most tickets touch (splitting or moving a shared file)
  `--labels solo`, so it runs with no other ticket beside it.

## Close
- Close the ticket only when a full `npm ci --no-audit --no-fund && npm run build && npm test` run passes after your last change.
- If a change can only be verified by CI (for example `.github/workflows/`, or a platform the
  local checks don't cover), close the ticket once `npm ci --no-audit --no-fund && npm run build && npm test` passes, with a note naming the
  CI job that will verify it ("Awaits CI: <job>"). The batch's pull request runs every CI job
  before anything reaches the main branch.
- If the ticket needs a decision only the maintainer can make, ask it as a question and stop; don't
  wait for an answer in this session. Commit any finished work first, then run
  `bd create --type=task --labels human --deps blocks:TICKET_ID --title "<the question, at most 60 characters>" --description "<the context, the options and your recommendation>"`
  and `bd update TICKET_ID --status open --append-notes "Waiting on <the question's ID>: <the question>"`.
  The ticket comes back to a worker once the question is answered.
- If the ticket depends on an answered question, read the answer first with `bd show <the question's ID>`.
- If you cannot finish: note why on the ticket, defer it, and stop.

When you are finished, say DONE and stop.
